## Git-flow

This project uses standard git-flow commit workflow as outlined in the [Git Flow page in the confluence wiki](https://vu-pmo.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PWEBSITE/Git+Flow).  A [cheatsheet](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) is also available.

## Code Review

Submitted code is subject to several checks before the feature or hotfix can be merged:

- [CircleCI](https://vu-pmo.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PWEBSITE/Continuous+Integration) runs code linting, Simpletest unit tests, and Behat tests
- At least two developers other than the author must give the pull request a thumbs up 
- Testers must approve the feature / hotfix

See the VU developer wiki entry on the [code review process](https://vu-pmo.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PWEBSITE/Code+review+process) for detailed information
