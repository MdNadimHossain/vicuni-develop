Feature: User Journeys - External Tools

  As a Student or Staff member
  I want to login to external systems
  So I can check email, collaborate or access the portal

  @api @journeys @PW-608
  Scenario: Login to MYVU Portal, VU collaborate and Student email
    Given I am on the homepage
    Then the links in region footer take me to the following pages:
      | Link           | Title                                              |
      | Student email  | Victoria University Central Authentication Service |
      | VU Collaborate | Victoria University Central Authentication Service |
      | MYVU Portal    | Victoria University Central Authentication Service |
