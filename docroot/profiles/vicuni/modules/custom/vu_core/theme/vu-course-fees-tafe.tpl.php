<p>The amount you pay for your course depends on whether you’re offered a government subsidised place or a full-fee paying place.</p>
<p>If you enrol in a:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Government subsidised place</strong>, you’ll pay a VET tuition fee and may be required to pay a Student Services and Amenities Fee and course materials contribution. This training is delivered with Victorian and Commonwealth Government funding.</li>
  <li><strong>full-fee paying place</strong>, you’ll pay the full-fee tuition rate (which includes Student Services and Amenities Fee and any material fees).</li>
