<p>The amount you pay for your course depends on whether you’re a Commonwealth supported student or full-fee paying.</p>
<p>If you enrol in a:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/study-at-vu/fees-scholarships/course-tuition-fees/commonwealth-supported-students">Commonwealth Supported Place</a>, your fees are partly subsidised by the Australian Government.</li>
  <li><a href="/study-at-vu/fees-scholarships/course-tuition-fees/full-fee-paying-students">full-fee paying place</a>, you’ll need to pay the full amount for all units you study.</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate the total cost of your course:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select which units you’d like to study.</li>
  <li>Look up the individual unit costs in the <a href="/sites/default/files/he-unit-domestic-fees.pdf">higher education unit of study fees list</a>.</li>
  <li>Add up the relevant amounts.</li>
</ol>
