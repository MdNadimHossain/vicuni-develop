<p>We are the first Australian university to use a 'block' model of learning, where you study one unit at a time rather than juggling several at once.</p>
<p>Introduced in 2018, the VU Block Model has improved our student results and achievements, and has won awards for innovation and excellence. Initially for first-year students, it now applies to all students studying at our Melbourne campuses.</p>
<p>You'll study in short bursts, called blocks, of three 2-3 hour face-to-face teaching sessions per week.</p>
<p>Each block focuses on one unit (subject) and is only four weeks long, with up to four days between. Our two semesters have four blocks each, and there are optional blocks over winter and summer where you can catch up on a missed unit.</p>
<p>Some courses have labs and pracs too, and these are generally scheduled on the same days as teaching sessions. There are also workshops where you'll develop your study skills and prepare for your future career.</p>
